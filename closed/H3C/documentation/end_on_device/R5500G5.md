# H3C UniServer R5500 G5 System Architecture

[H3C UniServer R5500 G5](https://download.h3c.com.cn/download.do?id=6539243) system supports the [GPUDirect](https://developer.nvidia.com/gpudirect) capability of NVIDIA GPUs to transfer data directly from PCIe devices (e.g. network, storage or camera) to GPU device memory. Each pair of A100 GPUs in the system is connected to a PCIe-Gen4 bridge, which is also connected to two Mellanox CX6 NICs with bandwidth of 200 Gb/s.

The highest bandwidth requirement for any of H3C's submissions is 3D-Unet which requires 0.55 GB/s. H3C has measured over 20 GB/s per GPU.
