# XE8545 System Architecture

The [Dell EMC PowerEdge XE8545](https://www.delltechnologies.com/resources/en-gb/asset/data-sheets/products/servers/dell-emc-poweredge-xe8545-spec-sheet.pdf) system supports the [GPUDirect](https://developer.nvidia.com/gpudirect) capability of NVIDIA GPUs to transfer data direct from PCIe devices (e.g. network, storage, or camera) directly to GPU device memory. The XE8545 is a switchless, PCIe-Gen4 server with two 3rd Generation AMD EPYC processors. The tested config has a 2-to-1 ratio of NVIDIA A100 SXM4 GPUs to Mellanox CX6 NICs.

We enabled GPUDirect on ResNet50, SSD-ResNet34, SSD-MobileNet, BERT, and 3D-UNET based on Dell's internal bandwidth measurements. The highest bandwidth requirement per GPU for the listed benchmarks is 5.285GB/s on XE8545; the system is able to meet this requirement.   

We also enabled the end_on_device flag for 3D-Unet based on those same internal bandwidth measurements.
