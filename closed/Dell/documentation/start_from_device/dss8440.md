# DSS 8440 System Architecture

The [Dell EMC DSS 8440](https://www.delltechnologies.com/asset/en-us/products/servers/technical-support/dss8440-server-specsheet-cascade-lake.pdf) system supports the [GPUDirect](https://developer.nvidia.com/gpudirect) capability of NVIDIA GPUs to transfer data direct from PCIe devices (e.g. network, storage, or camera) directly to GPU device memory. The DSS 8440 has 4 PCIe switches, PCIe-Gen3 server with two 2nd Generation Intel Xeon Scalable Processors. 

A100-PCIex10:
The tested config has a 3-to-1 ratio of A100 PCIe GPUs to Mellanox CX6 NICs.

We enabled GPUDirect only on SSD-ResNet34 and BERT based on Dell's internal bandwidth measurements. 

We also disabled the end_on_device flag for 3D-Unet based on those same internal bandwidth measurements.
