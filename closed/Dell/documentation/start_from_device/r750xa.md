# R750xa System Architecture

The [Dell EMC PowerEdge R750xa](https://i.dell.com/sites/csdocuments/Product_Docs/en/poweredge-R750xa-spec-sheet.pdf) system supports the [GPUDirect](https://developer.nvidia.com/gpudirect) capability of NVIDIA GPUs to transfer data direct from PCIe devices (e.g. network, storage, or camera) directly to GPU device memory. The R750xa is a switchless, PCIe-Gen4 server with two 3rd Generation Intel Xeon Scalable Processors. The tested config has a 1-to-1 ratio of A100 PCIe GPUs to Mellanox CX6 NICs.

We enabled GPUDirect on ResNet50, SSD-ResNet34, DLRM, RNNT, 3D-Unet and BERT based on Dell's internal bandwidth measurements. 

We also enabled the end_on_device flag for 3D-Unet based on those same internal bandwidth measurements.
