MLPerf Results Summary
================================================
SUT name : Concurrent_Triton_Server
Scenario : Server
Mode     : PerformanceOnly
Scheduled samples per second : 3519.20
Result is : INVALID
  Performance constraints satisfied : NO
  Min duration satisfied : NO
  Min queries satisfied : NO
  Early stopping satisfied: NO
Recommendations:
 * Reduce target QPS to improve latency.
 * Increase the target QPS so the loadgen pre-generates more queries.
 * The test exited early, before enough queries were issued.
   See the detailed log for why this may have occurred.
Early Stopping Result:
 * Run unsuccessful.
 * Processed 64 queries.
 * Would need to run at least 598 more queries,
 with the run being successful if every additional
 query were under latency.
